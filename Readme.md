# Web worker in React ðŸ•¸

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ worker/
â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ libWorker.ts
â”‚   â”‚    â””â”€â”€ webApiWorker.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useKoaleWorker.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useWebApiWorker.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tsx
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

The `hooks/` directory has three hooks to run the web workers. `useWebApiWorker.ts` runs using inbuilt web-worker API. `useKoaleWorker.ts` runs using [Koale](https://github.com/alewin/useworker) library.

The `worker` directory contains worker scripts `libWorker.ts` and `webApiWorker.ts`. The `libWorker.ts` and `webApiWorker.ts` files has function that is going to run on web workers. `webApiWorker.ts` funciton is to run on `useWebApiWorker` and `libWorker.ts` funciton is to run on `useKoaleWorker` hook.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
